   * A transaction is the smallest unit of work of Crafter app.
   * This tends to be as ACID as possible. (mainly from wikipedia)
   * Atomicity: A transaction's changes to the model state are atomic: either all happen or none happen.
   * Consistency: A transaction is a correct transformation of the model state. It is the responsability of the model to accept, reject or throw to any changes.
   *  Also, the system will rollback to the previous stable state if it throws during transaction.
   * Isolation: The transaction execution is syncrhronous. It is no possible to have async command during transaction or having two transactions in the same times.
   * Durability: Once a transaction completes successfully, its changes are saved as patch (with rollback/forward command list) and a snapshot of the new model.
