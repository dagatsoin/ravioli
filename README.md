# Ravioli
Stop doing spaghetti code.
The goal of ravioli is to code quick but not dirty.
One raviolo is like a spaghetti bolognese plate, but minified and well organized. Also, it does not spread on you neighbours when you are hurry.

Heavely inspired by [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/). Ravioli implements the [SAM pattern](https://sam.js.org/) for making easy to build complex applications like a todo list or a MMORPG.
